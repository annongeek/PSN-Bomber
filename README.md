# PSN-Bomber
Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Tusitn/">Tustin</a> for the PSN Lib.<br>
I wrote this PSN Bomber because someone was selling one, Who doesn't like FREE?<br>
It's extremely easy to use, right now it has a captcha + a time limit to prevent spam/autoclickers.<br>
It's also logging each and every request PSN-IP-MESSAGE-DATELINE<br>
